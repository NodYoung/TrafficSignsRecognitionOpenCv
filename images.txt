In order to run the code, you  need to have the data set on your computer. 
It can be dawloaded via :http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset


For this project only a subset of this data set has been used, ie:  the traffic signs for categories :
{13,14,15,17,19,20,21,27,33,34,35,36,37}.

So  download the images from these 13 categories and store them in a folder called "Images"  in  the same directory as the
others .cpp  files.

However,  you can  still  test the code on the entire data set if you want, but remember to do some few modifications 
to the code accordingly. (let me notice if you need help)
